# Impact of Prenatal Noise Pollution on Birthweight

## Project Overview

This research project investigates the relationship between prenatal exposure to noise pollution and birthweight outcomes. By integrating environmental, demographic, and health data, we aim to understand how environmental noise may affect fetal development and birth outcomes.

## Data Sources

### Primary Datasets

**EJScreen Environmental Data**
- Source: Harvard Dataverse
- DOI: [10.7910/DVN/JISNPL](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/JISNPL)
- Description: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool data providing noise pollution exposure metrics and other environmental indicators at the census tract level

**Birth Records Data**
- Description: Zip Code-level birth outcome data including birthweight

**Geographic Crosswalk Files**
- Description: Geographic identifiers used to link individual birth records to census tract-level environmental exposures

**CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)**
- Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- Description: Census tract-level indicators of social vulnerability including socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, housing type, and transportation access

## Data Usage and Ethical Considerations

### Responsible Data Use

This project involves sensitive health information and recognizes the following ethical obligations:

- **Privacy Protection**: All birth record data containing personally identifiable information will be kept confidential and secure. Analysis will be conducted at aggregate or de-identified levels in compliance with applicable privacy regulations.

- **Vulnerability Acknowledgment**: Birth outcomes and environmental exposures disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This research acknowledges the structural inequities that contribute to differential exposure to environmental hazards.

- **Transparency**: Methods, limitations, and findings will be documented and shared in ways that respect affected communities and contribute to actionable knowledge.

- **Data Security**: All datasets will be stored securely with appropriate access controls. Sensitive data will not be shared publicly or used beyond the scope of this research project.

### Sensitivity Statement

We recognize that this research involves:
- Maternal and infant health data that is deeply personal
- Environmental justice concerns affecting vulnerable populations
- Potential policy implications that may impact communities

All analysis and reporting will be conducted with careful consideration of these sensitivities and with the goal of contributing to improved health equity and environmental justice.
